When asked what I would do if I had infinite programing skills I feel as if only 3 things come to mind. Number one creating a game yeah, 
I mean who hasn’t dreamt about building a blockbuster game so good it would send kids digging for their parent’s credit cards. 
One so good that ready player one would no longer be a pipe dream but a reality. 
Its textures and frames would be so smooth tears would stream down anyone’s eye who had seen its trailer.
Now all credits to Phin from Spiderman Miles Morales the game because I’m going to need me that programmable matter. 
I mean imagine physical matter that can be conformed into any shape or size giving its user the ability to either be a hero or a villain. 
Like, that’s insane but not as insane as me creating my own supercomputer ai Jarvis.
Enhanced with all the world’s search engines and satellites he would be unstoppable.
